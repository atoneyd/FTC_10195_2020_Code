br = Back right wheel
FoundationServo1 = The left servo used to move foundation
FoundationServo2 = The right servo used to move foundation

blPos = Back left wheel position (used for encoders)
brPos = Back right wheel position (used for encoders)

To do 12/27:
1. Try both copies of code, see if one works
2. If neither works, look at telemetry to see if it is updating and getting closer to the value requested
